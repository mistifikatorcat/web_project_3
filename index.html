                        <p class="city__paragraph">Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on the
                            shores of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right mind would swim in the river,
                            unless they grew up here, in which case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are
                            hot here, and the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring are are absolutely
                            amazing.</p>
                        <p class="city__paragraph">The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet
                            architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of
                            the Dnipro, the landscape is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing
                            heels. The left bank is considered far less interesting and prestigious though, even by
                            people who live on the far outskirts of the right one.</p>

                            rock that juts out into the sea. It is thought to have been built by Llewelyn the Great in
                            the 13th century. Some 900 years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of
                            Snowdonia has become a popular tourist destination during the summer months.</p>
                        <p class="city__paragraph">A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the world's
                            best ice cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced
                            seaweed. Another claim to fame is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom award for
                            five years in a row for its spectacular floral displays around town. It was also home to
                            David Lloyd George, the only Welshman ever to hold the office of Prime Minister of the UK.

                            capital of the state, and visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops with
                            handmade jewelry, candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios, and more. The town holds a
                            yearly festival celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish made with cornbread and served with a
                            wooden spoon.</p>
                        <p class="city__paragraph">However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea
                            College was founded in 1855 and was the first college in the south to be racially
                            integrated, as well as the first to be coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no
                            tuition — every student receives a full-tuition scholarship.</p>

                            it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. It is located in the center of

                            coldest places in the province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest

                            altitude. It is filled with beautiful vegetation, and a source for the various rivers and

                            Russian Empire, and was the largest cultural center in Russia. Even today, Saint-Petersburg
                            is reffered as a "Cultural Capital". It is quite a big city with plenty of places to visit.
